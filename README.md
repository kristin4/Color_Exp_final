# Color_Exp_final

Coding for Color Experiment

This Repository includes the codes for the color experiment preparation and data evaluation.

PREPROCES
This code extracts the experimental data from Raw_Data.txt and adds informations from AoI.txt, click.txt and Onset.txt. In the end this code saves the most important columns for the statistical evaluation in final_data.txt

Preproc_1.pynb - this file contains the preprocessing code to create the table for the statistial analysis. The files 'AoI.txt', 'Raw_Data_farben' and 'Onset' as well as 'click_data_seperate.txt' are used in the preprocessing to add all relevant columns to the table.

Onset.txt - Contains the Onset times of the adjective syllables for each items in each condition

AoI.txt - Contains the coordinates of the AoI of each item (target, competitor, distractor) 

Raw_Data_farben.txt - Contains the extracted data from the eye-tracking experiment

click_data_seperate.txt - Contains the click information of each participant for each item
